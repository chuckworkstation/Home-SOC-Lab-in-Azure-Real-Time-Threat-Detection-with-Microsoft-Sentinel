# Home-SOC-Lab-in-Azure-Real-Time-Threat-Detection-with-Microsoft-Sentinel

Overview:
This hands-on lab simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) using a free Azure environment. I built a cloud-based honeypot, integrated Microsoft Sentinel, and visualized live attack data on a map to showcase key skills in cloud security, log analysis, and threat detection.

# Key Features:

🚀 Created an Azure VM to act as a public-facing honeypot

🔗 Configured Log Analytics Workspace for centralized log collection

📊 Integrated Microsoft Sentinel to monitor and analyze attack patterns

🧠 Queried real-time failed login attempts

🌍 Built a custom attack map to visualize global hacker activity

# Skills Demonstrated:

Cloud Security (Azure, Sentinel)

SIEM Integration & Analysis

Threat Hunting & Detection

Log Forwarding & Querying

SOC Architecture Design
